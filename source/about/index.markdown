# Welcome to Hacker Labs.

My name is Deepak Kandepet. Hacker Labs is my playground where I have fun with the latest innovations, products and technologies from around the web. I am a back-end engineer by profession, working for one of the best search engine companies, but I love web-programming and spend most of my non-work hours dabbling in something related to it. See more of my professional work on LinkedIn.

I am an entrepreneur in the making and co-founded couple of companies : prep.ly,  samefeather.com,  trendwars.com.

I truly believe in minimalism, especially when it comes to design and programming. I strongly believe that content should speak for itself and style should get out of the way. You will see that in most of my work.

## Technology behind the blog

HackerLabs.co is built on WordPress and the theme is based on svbtle (created by Dustin Curtis). Svbtle theme was ported to WordPress by Gravity On Mars, I hacked it to make it more suitable for me. You can find my version of this theme on GitHub.

## Logo

The logo is a circular QR code I created. Go ahead, scan it and see where it takes you.
