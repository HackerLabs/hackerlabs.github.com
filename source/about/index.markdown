# Welcome to Hacker Labs.

{% img profile-picture /images/MeCartoonized.png 100 100 %}
My name is Deepak Kandepet. Hacker Labs is my playground where I have fun with the latest innovations, products and technologies from around the web. I am a search engineer by profession, working for one of the best search engine companies, but I am a full-stack engineer and I love to dabble with everything from Linux drivers, Linux kernel, TCP/IP stack, high performance programming and especially love web-programming and spend most of my non-work hours dabbling in something related to it.

I am also an entrepreneur in the making and co-founded couple of companies : [prep.ly](http://prep.ly "prep.ly"),  [samefeather.com](http://samefeather.com),  [trendwars.com](trendwars.com).

For fun, I play tennis. I also hold an Amateur Radio License and occassionally you can hear me hamming as KJ6VWB.

<!--I truly believe in minimalism, especially when it comes to design and programming. I strongly believe that content should speak for itself and style should get out of the way. You will see that in most of my work.-->

## Technology behind the blog

Hacker Labs is powered by [OctoPress](http://octopress.org) and hosted on [github](https://github.com/HackerLabs) as a static page. The theme is based on [svbtle](http://svbtle.com) (created by Dustin Curtis). Svbtle theme was ported to WordPress by Gravity On Mars, I hacked it to work with OctoPress and made it more suitable for me. You can find my version of this theme on [GitHub](https://github.com/HackerLabs/hackerlabs.github.com/tree/source).

Since this site is just a bunch of static pages with no server-side generated code, I have to use external services for all the dynamic features. I use [Swiftype](http://swiftype.com) to power the site search, [wufoo](http://wufoo.com) for the contact form and [Disqus](http://disqus.com) for the comments.
